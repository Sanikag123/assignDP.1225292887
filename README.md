Working of the system: 
Enter the login details
1. If the user is a buyer, Buyer is allowed to view the menu and then is allowed to add the desired products as he/she wants to buy and bid its price. This system works for one product only for now (can be extended later). After the product is added it is compared with the offering presented by the seller and the final trade is decided as the options are given to the buyer on which trade to select and the trade is finalised.
2. If the user is a seller, he/she is allowed to view the menu and later is allowed to add the products which they want to add in the system as offerings. These offerings will be given to the buyer when he tries to buy a product.
